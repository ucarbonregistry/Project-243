Project History:
The project has been designed and developed based on the carbon revenue for long term sustainability. In this regard, project was initially designed for a larger capacity and was applied under Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of UNFCCC for a total capacity of 15 MW under two phases, 8 MW being the first phase and another 7 MW to be followed in due course. However, due to delay in the process and also affected by low carbon pricing the project could not be moved forward under CDM and hence status under CDM remains only at the listing stage (i.e. global stakeholder consultation level) and was not considered further. This information can be checked from the CDM web interface: https://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/Validation/DB/8A3OOEQ0XX722ANMLBA8HRTNJGQ460/view. html
